                           Supported platforms

1. GNU Linux (perhaps other UNIX-like systems too)
2. Microsoft Windows (compiled using mingw cross-compiler)

Prerequisities:
wxWidgets (2.8.x, 3.0.x): http://www.wxwidgets.org
python : http://www.python.org (only if you want to build it yourself)
scons:  http://www.scons.org   (only if you want to build it yourself)

If you want to build _ngp module (Python bindings to ngpcore high-level
interface) you will need python development files.

If you want to compile ngpview application you will need glut library.

To generate ngpcore API documentation xsltproc application
(http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html) is required. Note, that generated
documentation in html format is included in source package.


Building under GNU Linux (for Linux):

1. Untar source archive (ngplant-X.X.X.tar.gz)
2. $ cd ngplant-X.X.X
3. $ scons


Building under GNU Linux (for Windows):

1. Untar source archive (ngplant-X.X.X.tar.gz)
2. $ cd ngplant-X.X.X
3. Edit file cross-sample.py located at config directory (or create new one)
   and set variables which describe your system setup. Do not
   forget to set variable "cross" to "yes".
4. $ scons config=<name_of_config>
   For example, if your configuration file is named "cross-sample.py", use
   $ scons config=cross-sample


Building under macOS:

There is now a new configuration file for macOS (config/macos.py) to allow SCons
to find everything it needs.

1. Prerequisites
   1.1 Homebrew: install it from https://brew.sh e.g.:
       $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   1.2 Install the following formulae:
       $ brew install scons wxmac freeglut pyenv pyenv-virtualenv pyenv-virtualenvwrapper \
         pyenv-which-ext glew libpng libjpeg
2. Clone the sources from GitHub:
   2.2 $ cd ~/Developer
   2.3 $ git clone https://github.com/stager13/ngplant.git
3. $ cd ngplant
4. $ scons ngplant config=macos
5. Create application bundle structure:
   $ cd ~/Downloads
   $ ~/Developer/ngplant/devtools/macosx/mkdmg.sh ~/Developer/ngplant/
6. Now go to the Finder, and under the Downloads folder you should have a DMG image with an application inside that you can install as usual.


Building under Windows with Microsoft Visual C++ using SCons (experimental):

1. Make sure you have the following prerequisities installed:
   1.1 Visual C++ compiler (Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition was tested)
   1.2 Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/)
   1.3 SCons software construction tool (http://www.scons.org/)
   1.4 wxWidgets development files (headers and libraries)
       (http://wxwidgets.org/). For detailed information on choosing correct
       version and files for download read instruction from wxwidgets project:
       http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-to-use-294-wxmsw-binaries.html.
2. Create configuration file msvc.py inside config directory with the following
   content:

   WINDRES = "rc"
   WX_DIR = "<MY_WX_LOCATION>"
   WX_INC     = WX_DIR + "\\include\\ " + WX_DIR + "\\include\\msvc"
   WX_LIB     = ""
   WX_LIBPATH = WX_DIR + "\\lib\\vc120_dll"

   Replace <MY_WX_LOCATION> with the path to your wxwidgets files. You may need
to change vc120_dll string depending on what version of Visual Studio you're
using.
3. Build ngplant application with the following command:
   scons config=msvc ngplant/ngplant.exe

Building under Windows with Microsoft Visual C++ using Visual Studio IDE
(experimental):

1. Make sure you have the following prerequisities installed:
   1.1 Visual Studio IDE (Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition was tested)
   1.2 Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/)
   1.3 wxWidgets development files (headers and libraries)
       (http://wxwidgets.org/). For detailed information on choosing correct
       version and files for download read instruction from wxwidgets project:
       http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-to-use-294-wxmsw-binaries.html.
2. Set environment variable wxwin to point to the directory where you placed
your wxwidgets files.
3. Make sure that PATH environment variable contains the path to python.exe.
4. Open ngplant.sln file and build all projects.
5. You may need add path to your wxwidgets dll's to the PATH environment
variable in order to run ngplant.exe.


Texture path(s) setup:
- Use "Preferences" dialog ("File->Preferences...") to setup texture locations.

Plugins path setup:
- Use "Preferences" dialog ("File->Preferences...") to setup plugins path.
